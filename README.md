# Movie Explorer App

This is a react app that lets you search and pick your favorite movies from OMDb (The Open Movie Database) using OMDb API.

I started the project first sitting up the environment by creating the react app using vite. Next I installed Material UI as I have used a couple of icons in this project. 
After that I created the repository in github so I can keep track of changes. 
Next was to get the API key from OMDb site so we can fetch data from the Open Movie Database, which I got in my email after applying for a free type account. 

After that was the process of creating the different react components. I created a header, search, card and card list components. The search component lets you search OMDb by movie title. 
Every movie card gets the title, poster, release date, genre and the plot data from OMDb. The movie card also has a favorite icon that lets you add these movies to the favorite section. 
The favorite movies are saved locally in the browser localStorage. 

I have also added pagination as you can load more movies by clicking on the load more button. As for styling I have used CSS modules. 
In the end I deployed this project to github pages.
